We look at our own simple imperative language - runxy.

Interpreter.hs - a simple imperative language interpreter.
Parser.hs - a parser for our language.
AbstractSyntax.hs - specifies the abstract syntax for our language.

There are three programs for you to test, written in runxy. Follow the instructions in Main.hs in order to execute them. Enjoy!
